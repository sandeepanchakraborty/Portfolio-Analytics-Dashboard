- This project is a MERN-style full-stack app, but the backend uses an Excel file as the database via the `xlsx` library.
- Backend endpoints should read/write/update the Excel file for all CRUD operations.
- Do not use MongoDB or Mongoose.
- Frontend is a React app in the `client` folder.
- Backend is an Express app in the `server` folder.
- Implement analytics endpoints by processing the Excel data.
- Use best practices for error handling and file I/O.
